      <h2>Flexible Mortgage Solutions for Self-Employed & Investors</h2>
      <p>Not every borrower fits inside the traditional mortgage box — and that’s where <strong>Non-QM (Non-Qualified Mortgage)</strong> programs shine. If you’re self-employed, own multiple businesses, or invest in rental properties, <strong>Trusted Statewide</strong> offers solutions designed to work with your unique income situation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Non-QM Programs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bank Statement Loans</strong> – Qualify using 12–24 months of bank statements instead of tax returns.</li>
        <li><strong>DSCR Investor Loans</strong> – Qualify based on property cash flow, not personal income.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset Depletion Loans</strong> – Use your liquid assets to demonstrate ability to repay.</li>
        <li><strong>1099 Income Loans</strong> – Designed for independent contractors and gig workers.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest-Only & Expanded DTI Options</strong> – Perfect for maximizing cash flow.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who Benefits from Non-QM Loans</h2>
      <p>Entrepreneurs, real estate investors, business owners, and retirees often use Non-QM programs to qualify for financing that traditional lenders might decline. If you have strong credit and income but a unique financial profile, this could be your ideal solution.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Why homeowners tap home equity in California</h2>
        <p>
          Home equity is one of the most flexible financial tools homeowners have. Whether you’re funding renovations, consolidating higher-cost debt, or creating retirement income, the right approach depends on your goals and your property.
          Trusted Statewide helps California homeowners evaluate options and choose the path that reduces risk while maximizing value.

      <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Cash-Out Refinance</h3>
        <p>
          A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new, larger loan and gives you the difference in cash. It’s an efficient option for homeowners who want a single payment and current low-term financing.
          This can be a smart move if you need a lump sum for major projects or to consolidate debt, and your credit and equity position are suitable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)</h3>
        <p>
          HELOCs provide flexible access to funds via a line of credit secured by your home. They work well for ongoing expenses or projects with uncertain costs.
          Because HELOCs typically have variable rates, they can suit borrowers who need short-term access and have a clear repayment plan.
        </p>

      <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Home Equity Loan</h3>
        <p>
          A home equity loan provides a fixed lump-sum payment and a fixed-rate repayment schedule. It’s a good fit when you prefer predictable payments and know the exact amount you need.
        </p>

      <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Reverse Mortgage (HECM)</h3>
        <p>
          For homeowners 62 and older, a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) can convert equity to cash without monthly mortgage payments. Reverse mortgages have unique rules and considerations; they can be a useful retirement tool when used responsibly.
        </p>

      <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        <h3 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Non-traditional options & investor programs</h3>
        <p>
          Self-employed borrowers and investors may benefit from bank-statement loans, DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) programs, or custom non-QM products. These options often accept alternative documentation and can unlock financing when standard routes don’t fit.

        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">How to choose the right option</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Clarify your goal:</strong> renovation, debt consolidation, cash-out, or retirement income.</li>
          <li><strong>Assess your timeline:</strong> immediate funds vs. long-term planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Review your equity and loan-to-value (LTV):</strong> more equity increases available options.</li>
          <li><strong>Compare costs and payment structure:</strong> fixed vs. variable, monthly payment vs. line of credit.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:20px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">What to prepare before you apply</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Recent mortgage statement or payoff information</li>
          <li>Two months of bank statements (or more for self-employed borrowers)</li>
          <li>Recent W-2s, pay stubs, or tax returns</li>
          <li>Proof of homeowner’s insurance and property taxes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Preparing these documents ahead of time speeds underwriting and improves chances of a fast, clean approval.

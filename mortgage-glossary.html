  <h2>APR – Annual Percentage Rate</h2>
  <p>The APR represents the total cost of borrowing, including interest and fees. It helps you compare loan options more accurately.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)</h2>
  <p>DTI compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income. Lower DTI ratios improve your chance of approval.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)</h2>
  <p>LTV is the percentage of the home's price financed with a mortgage. Lower LTV often results in better terms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Jumbo Loan</h2>
  <p>A loan amount above conforming limits. Common in California due to high home prices. Learn more in our <a href="/jumbo-loans-2025.html">Jumbo Loan Guide</a>.</p>

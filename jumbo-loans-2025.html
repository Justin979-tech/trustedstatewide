      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">Why jumbo loans matter in California right now</h2>
        <p>
          In many California markets, buyers encounter property prices that exceed conforming mortgage limits. That’s where jumbo loans come in — they let qualified borrowers purchase high-value homes
          or refinance large balances. Jumbo underwriting is stricter, but with the right profile and preparation, approval is very achievable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">1) Build and maintain strong credit</h2>
        <p>
          Credit quality is the foundation of jumbo approval. Lenders typically favor applicants with solid credit history and scores that demonstrate reliable repayment behavior.
          Start by reviewing your credit reports for errors, reducing high-rate balances, and maintaining on-time payments. Small improvements in score can unlock significantly better program options.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">2) Lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</h2>
        <p>
          Jumbo lenders evaluate DTI carefully. A lower DTI shows you have capacity to carry a larger mortgage. Where possible, pay down high-interest debts, avoid new monthly obligations,
          and consider temporarily increasing income documentation visibility (bonuses, commissions, or partner income).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">3) Prepare a larger down payment and show reserves</h2>
        <p>
          Lenders like to see meaningful down payment and cash reserves after closing. Having several months of mortgage payments in reserve reduces perceived risk and can improve program access.
          Consider assembling clear asset documentation: bank statements, retirement account summaries, and brokerage statements are typically accepted.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">4) Solid, well-documented income</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you’re a W-2 employee, business owner, or investor, consistent and verifiable income removes underwriting friction. For W-2 borrowers, the standard is a stable employment history; for self-employed borrowers,
          lenders rely on tax returns, profit-and-loss statements, or bank-statement documentation depending on the program. If your income is complex, choose a program designed for your profile.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">5) Choose the right jumbo program</h2>
        <p>
          Not all jumbo loans are the same. Some programs favor low DTI and high liquidity; others accept alternative documentation or are geared to investors. Work with a lender who can map your profile to the right program quickly,
          so you don’t waste time on options that won’t fit.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">6) Strengthen the property profile</h2>
        <p>
          Appraisals and property condition matter more on jumbo files. Clean comps, well-maintained homes, and clear title documentation reduce appraisal risks. If you’re refinancing, present recent home improvements or strong rental history (for investment properties).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section style="margin-bottom:22px;">
        <h2 style="color:#0b4a8b;">7) Present compensating factors</h2>
        <p>
          If one metric is borderline, compensating factors — higher reserves, larger down payment, lower DTI, or substantial liquid assets — can tip the scale. Make a clear, organized packet that shows your full financial strength up front.
